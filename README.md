# Fake-News-Detection

This repository contains a machine-learning model for detecting fake news using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Fake news detection is crucial in today's digital age, where misinformation spreads rapidly. This project aims to provide a reliable solution for identifying deceptive information in news articles.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language used for building the machine learning model.

Scikit-Learn: A powerful machine learning library in Python, used for implementing the SVM classifier.

Pandas: A data manipulation library used for handling datasets and data preprocessing.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A natural language processing library in Python, helpful for text analysis and processing.

Google Colaboratory: An web interactive development environment used for experimentation and analysis.
